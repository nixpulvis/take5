# A Rust implementation of [Take 5!][1]

Written for CS4500 at Northeastern University (circa 2015).

### Playing Locally

In addition to the game library in `src/` this project comes with both a simple AI and a `STDPlayer` implementation used in `take5-cli`.

```sh
cargo run -p take5-cli -- --help
```

### Tests

```sh
cargo test --all
```
